# Lighting - by MarcosJSP

The objective of this project is to get familiarized  with lighting. 

The project shows a terrain inflating and deflating while a static source of light which is the white ball placed over the terrain illuminates its surroundings:

## Development

The terrain inflating and deflating allows us to see how the terrain chunks that are closer to the light source get more brightened while the ones that are further away get darker. Also to make it more clear if we press `B KEY` a metallic marvel pops up getting lighter and lighter the closer it is to the light source.



The controls are the following:

| Key                  | Action                   |
| :------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `W`                  | Move camera forward      |
| `S`                  | Move camera backwards    |
| `A`                  | Move camera leftwards    |
| `D`                  | Move camera rightwards   |
| `CNTRL`              | Move camera downwards    |
| `SPACE-BAR`          | Move camera upwards      |
| `Left click dragged` | Rotates camera target    |
| `B`                  | Shows up metallic marvel |
